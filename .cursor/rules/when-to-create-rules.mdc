# When to Create or Update Cursor Rules

This document outlines when you should create or update cursor rules in this codebase.

## When to CREATE a new rule

Create a new cursor rule file when:

1. **Architectural patterns or conventions** that are used across multiple files or modules
   - Example: A specific pattern for handling errors, authentication, or data validation
   - Example: A convention for organizing services or controllers

2. **Complex domain logic** that requires explanation beyond what's obvious from the code
   - Example: Business rules that aren't self-evident
   - Example: Workflows that span multiple components

3. **Important design decisions** that affect how code should be written or organized
   - Example: Why certain patterns are preferred over alternatives
   - Example: Constraints that must be maintained (e.g., database schema relationships)

4. **Recurring patterns** that appear in multiple places and should be followed consistently
   - Example: API response formatting conventions
   - Example: Error handling patterns

5. **Project structure conventions** that help navigate or understand the codebase
   - Example: Where to find specific types of files
   - Example: How different parts of the application interact

## When to UPDATE an existing rule

Update an existing rule when:

1. **The pattern or convention has changed** - Update the rule to reflect the new approach
2. **New information is discovered** - Add missing details that would help future development
3. **The rule is outdated** - Remove or update information that's no longer accurate
4. **The scope has expanded** - Add new examples or use cases that weren't covered

## When NOT to create a rule

Do NOT create a rule for:

1. **One-off implementations** - Single-use code that won't be repeated
2. **Simple, self-explanatory code** - Code that's clear without additional context
3. **Temporary solutions** - Code that's meant to be replaced soon
4. **Standard library usage** - Common patterns that are well-documented elsewhere
5. **Minor variations** - Small differences that don't represent a pattern

## Rule file organization

- Place rules in `.cursor/rules/` directory at the appropriate level (root, `back-end/`, `front-end/`, etc.)
- Use descriptive filenames that indicate the rule's purpose
- Set `alwaysApply: true` for rules that should be active in every conversation
- Group related rules logically (e.g., project structure, coding conventions, architecture)

## Best practices

- **Keep rules focused** - Each rule should cover a specific topic or pattern
- **Keep rules current** - Review and update rules periodically as the codebase evolves
- **Use examples** - Include concrete examples when they clarify the rule
- **Be concise** - Rules should be helpful, not overwhelming
