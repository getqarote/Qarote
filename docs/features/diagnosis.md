# Incident Diagnosis Engine

The diagnosis engine evaluates a registry of rules against pre-computed
broker signals every five minutes and surfaces actionable findings on the
**Diagnosis** page. Each rule is a sync pure function that consumes
`IncidentSignals` (queue snapshots, broker nodes, connections, channels,
queue metadata) and emits zero or more `IncidentDiagnosis` rows.

This page is the operator-facing rule catalogue. For the architecture and
slicing strategy, see `docs/plans/diagnosis-rules-sourcing.md`.

> **Editions:** the rules-based detection engine — the findings, severities,
> and the Diagnosis page itself — is **free** in the Community Edition and on
> every plan. Only the AI-powered **"Explain this finding"** layer
> (`ai_explain_inline`) is an Enterprise/licensed feature. In short: **CE
> detects, EE explains with AI.**

## How rules fire

Every rule has a citation (`meta.sourceUrl`) on a small allowlist of
canonical RabbitMQ sources. The registry rejects rules without a
citation at boot — there is no "legacy" escape hatch. When a rule
fires:

1. The finding is appended to the in-memory result.
2. The cascade-collapse pass marks symptoms whose cause is also firing
   (see `MEMORY_ALARM_ACTIVE` / `DISK_ALARM_ACTIVE` →
   `PUBLISHER_FLOW_CONTROL`).
3. The dedup pass upserts a row in `incident_diagnosis_records` keyed
   by `(serverId, fingerprint)` where `fingerprint = SHA256(scope,
ruleId, queueName, vhost)` (NUL-separated). Re-firing bumps `lastSeenAt`; first firing
   sets `firstSeenAt`.
4. The cleanup pass marks records resolved when their `lastSeenAt` is
   older than the dedup TTL (5 min).

## Per-workspace kill switch

Operators can silence a misbehaving rule for one workspace without a
release by inserting a row in `diagnosis_rule_configs` with `enabled =
false`. Default-enabled, opt-out semantics — a missing row means the
rule fires.

## Dry-run mode

`diagnoseServer(serverId, workspaceId, windowMinutes, { dryRun: true })`
runs every rule against live signals but bypasses both the cache and the
fingerprint persistence. Use it to tune thresholds before promoting a rule.

### Queue-scoped (snapshot-driven)

| Rule                | Severity | Source                                                                       | What it detects                                                              |
| ------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

### Broker-scoped Tier A — alarm and flow-control cascade

| Rule                     | Severity | Source                                                             | What it detects                                                            |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MEMORY_ALARM_ACTIVE`    | CRITICAL | [`/docs/memory-use`](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/memory-use)     | Any node has `mem_alarm: true`. Supersedes `PUBLISHER_FLOW_CONTROL`.       |
| `DISK_ALARM_ACTIVE`      | CRITICAL | [`/docs/disk-alarms`](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/disk-alarms)   | Any node has `disk_free_alarm: true`. Supersedes `PUBLISHER_FLOW_CONTROL`. |

### Queue-scoped Tier A — structural

| Rule                           | Severity | Source                                                                       | What it detects                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NO_CONSUMER_PERSISTENT_QUEUE` | HIGH     | [`/docs/queues`](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/queues)                       | Durable queue with persistent messages and zero consumers across a 30-min window. |

### Tier B — capability-gated

These rules check `signals.brokerVersion.majorMinor` at evaluate time and
skip on older brokers. A workspace with mixed broker versions fires the
rule only on the brokers that support the feature.

| Rule                        | Min RMQ | Severity | Source                                                                     | What it detects                                                                |
| --------------------------- | ------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CLASSIC_QUEUE_V1_LARGE`    | 3.10    | LOW      | [`/docs/persistence-conf`](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/persistence-conf) | Classic CQv1 queue with > 100k messages — recommend CQv2 or quorum migration.  |
| `QUORUM_LEADER_CHURN`       | 3.8     | HIGH     | [`/docs/quorum-queues`](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/quorum-queues)       | Quorum queue with messages and zero consumers (proxy for wedged Raft cluster). |
| `STREAM_NO_OFFSET_TRACKING` | 3.9     | MEDIUM   | [`/docs/streams`](https://www.rabbitmq.com/docs/streams)                   | Stream with consumers and ≥ 1k messages but accumulating depth.                |

### Tier C — research candidates

Nine candidates have research notes under
`docs/research/diagnosis-rules/` (seven `needs-more-research`, two
`reject`). Each ends in a single `Decision: ship | reject |
needs-more-research` line. None are wired today; reasons are in
the per-note `Decision` block.

## "Explain this finding" — situated LLM explanations

Each finding carries an **Explain** CTA. When clicked, the API
assembles a prompt grounded in the live cluster state (broker alarms,
queue config, queue topology, seasonal baselines, recent operator
mutations, co-firing findings) and streams an explanation back. The
LLM never replaces a deterministic rule — it explains the rule's
output in context, with concrete numbers from the actual cluster.

### Firehose-derived evidence (optional, plan-dependent)

If the RabbitMQ broker has the `rabbitmq_tracing` plugin enabled and
Qarote's Firehose consumer is running, three additional evidence
sections are added to the prompt **when the data is available** for
the subject queue:

- **Fanout amplification** — publish/deliver ratio for the queue's
  dominant inbound exchange. Surfaces the multiplier cost of a fanout
  topology that polling metrics can't see.
- **Payload size shift** — median and p95 payload size shift between
  the last 5 minutes and the prior 55-minute baseline. Detects a
  sudden ×N message-size jump that often explains co-firing memory
  pressure + backlog growth.
- **Dead-letter rate** — rate of publishes on the queue's configured
  dead-letter exchange, with the dominant routing keys. Quantifies
  the effective application failure rate.

Each section carries an inline sampling marker (`n=…, confidence=…`)
so the model treats the numbers as observations rather than totals.
Sections are **fail-closed** — they are omitted entirely when the
data is unavailable, stale, or below the gate thresholds. The
explanation is always produced; the firehose sections only **enrich**
it when the data is there.

**Operator setup** (optional): enable the tracing plugin and bind
the standard `amq.rabbitmq.trace` exchange (`rabbitmqctl
trace_on -p <vhost>`). With no Firehose data, Explain falls back to
the broker-state / queue-config / topology context layers — the same
explanation quality as before this feature shipped.

## Telemetry

PostHog events emitted from the diagnosis surface:

| Event                | When                                 | Properties                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `diagnosis_feedback` | Operator clicks 👍 / 👎 on a finding | `ruleId`, `vote`, `severity`, `queueName`, `vhost` |

The `diagnosis_rule_fired` per-evaluation event is emitted from the
backend rule registry — see `apps/api/src/ee/services/incident/`. We
intentionally do not emit per-finding to avoid event-volume spikes
during long-running incidents (the dedup table is the source of truth
for "open since").
